# Probability

Probability, at its most basic level, is the number of ways a particular event can happen, divided by the number of ways all the events could happen.

A fair coin is tossed 3 times:
W = {HHH,HTH,HHT,HTT,TTT,THT,TTH,THH}
F = {HHH,HTH,HHT}
p(F|W)  = |FnW| / |W|
        = 3 / 4


Two die are tossed:

- Probability that the sum is at least 10?

{55,66}


B = {6} * {1,2,3,4,5,6}
|B| = 6

E = {}
|E| = 6

p(E|B) =    |EnB| / |B|
       =    3 / 6
